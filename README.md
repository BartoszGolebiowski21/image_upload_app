# Image upload app

Issues solved:
- uploading images by user via HTTP request,
- listing user's images,
- uploading images and generating thumbnails based on the user's tier.

Issues to solve:
- validation is not functioning correctly,
- custom tier functionality is not working,
- generation expiring links is not working,
- there are no unit tests.
- launching the application in a Docker container is not working; it is recommended to run it by creating a Virtual Environment from a previous commit.
